# GotWins! (By Joshua Warner, Stefan Yordanov and James Thompson) 

***Project Description***


The core purpose of this project is to allow people all over the world to share good news. We have sought to do this by creating a message board app which permits users to anonymously post the good things happening in their lives. In addition, we have provided an element of interactivity in our app which allows other users to submit replies - in the form of comments - to react to original posts. The app also has some nice features such as people being able to post gifs and emojis. We believe the spirit of our app goes against the view (which is perhaps widely held) that social media has evolved into something which merely amplifies negativity and contributes to a more adversarial society. 


***Installation***


Assuming you are cloning this repo onto your own machine, there is only 1 step that should be taken:


Navigate into the server folder in your terminal and run the command:


    npm install


This will install all relevant dependencies within a matter of seconds.


***Usage***

In order to run the app and get a sense of how it works, two steps are required:


1) Whilst in the server folder, run the following command in your terminal:


   npm start


This will start the server at port 5000 (note to people using Macs, port 5000 may already be occupied due to Airplay Receiver already taking up the port. If that is the case, you will have to go into your System Preferences to switch it off).


2) Find one of the the html pages and open it in the browser (ideally using something like the VS Code extension Live Server).


***Technologies***

This app uses a range of technologies:


HTML

CSS

Vanilla JavaScript

Bootstrap

Node.js

Express.js


This app also relies on a number of node packages to work:

body-parser

express

cors

jsonfile

***Process***


*Conceiving the app as a platform where users can post good news, and deciding which categories should be included*

*Researching ways that the front end and back end can successfully interact with each other in real time*

*Work out the best way to store data - and different types of data - within a single JSON file.*

*Design a functional homepage and design the layout and appearance of each webpage*

*Build these webpages using HTML and CSS*

*Build url endpoints in the backend which allow the front end to both get data from the backend and also post data to the backend*

*Write functions which allow the JSON file to be updated in real time and those changes to be reflected in the front end in real time as well*

*Add additional functionality which allows users to post both emojis and gifs*

*Ensure other users can reply to posts*


***Wins***

Most of the bullet points in the process section should be regarded as wins.


***Challenges***

The biggest challenge was creating this piece of work in, effectively, three days.
